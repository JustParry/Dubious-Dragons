# Bygone

## Overview

**Bygone** is a game logic system and mythic world framework in which powerful beings known as *Dragonborne* receive supernatural abilities through devotion to one of the Great Dragons. Each Dragonborne’s powers, allegiances, and ultimate fate are determined by their homeland, their chosen god, and the divine gifts they inherit.

## Core Concept

Dragonborne may receive **4 out of 5 unique abilities** from a single god. They **cannot worship multiple gods**, and their **kingdom allegiance is locked** to their chosen deity. The fate of each kingdom rests in the hands of its Dragonborne champions — and in the legacy of the gods they serve.

### The Three Great Dragons & Their Kingdoms

- **Ouroboros**  
  - **Kingdom**: *Inanimus*  
  - A god of eternal death and rebirth. Ouroboros represents a cycle of life and death. Inanimus stands in the shadow of eternity, unable to reach it.

- **Yam**  
  - **Kingdom**: *Ignis*  
  - A god of storms, destruction, and wrath. Ignis is a kingdom that fully inhibits this destruction and wrath through their fiery resilience.

- **Mahoraga**  
  - **Kingdom**: *Subsisto*  
  - A god of harmony, progress, and change. Subsisto stands alongside this ideal as its perfect mirror.

### The Forbidden God: \\\\\\

Long before the current age, there was a **fourth god**, the **\\\\\\**. He was worshipped by the kingdom of **Impotens**, a people who named themselves in recognition of their own powerlessness without their god.

**\\\\\\ did not fall in battle**. However, when Ignis, under Yam’s banner, **destroyed Impotens and slaughtered its people**, \\\\\\ **withdrew from the world**, leaving behind only silence — and a curse.

- The **Brimstone curse** 

The **Brimstone Curse** is the condition the player has at the start of the game, which allows them to be inflicted with powers beyond their humanity.

\\\\\\ is **not an available god** at the start of the game. His path remains locked until the player **completes the story as all three ** — only then may they seek out what remains of the Human God.

## Features

- **Single-god devotion**: Your chosen god defines your powers, fate, and kingdom.
- **3-of-5 ability selection**: Customize your Dragonborne with divine powers.
- **Locked allegiances**: No switching sides — your god is your identity.
- **Hidden divine path**: Unlock \\\\\\ by completing all three Dragonborne campaigns.
- **Narrative-driven consequences**: Attempting to break the system leads to unforeseen consequences.

## Usage
