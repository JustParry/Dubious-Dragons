# Dragonborne: Divine Allegiances

## Overview

**Dragonborne: Divine Allegiances** is a game logic system and mythic world framework in which powerful beings known as *Dragonborne* receive supernatural abilities through devotion to one of the Great Dragons. Each Dragonborne’s powers, allegiances, and ultimate fate are determined by their homeland, their chosen god, and the divine gifts they inherit.

## Core Concept

Dragonborne may receive **3 out of 5 unique abilities** from a single god. They **cannot worship multiple gods**, and their **kingdom allegiance is locked** to their chosen deity. The fate of each kingdom rests in the hands of its Dragonborne champions — and in the legacy of the gods they serve.

### The Three Great Dragons & Their Kingdoms

- **Ouroboros**  
  - **Kingdom**: *Mors*  
  - A god of eternal cycles, rebirth, and decay. Mors stands in the shadow of eternity, its people defined by transformation and resilience.

- **Yam**  
  - **Kingdom**: *Ignis*  
  - A god of storms, destruction, and wrath. Ignis is a kingdom built on conquest, fire, and overwhelming force.

- **Mahoraga**  
  - **Kingdom**: *Subsisto*  
  - A god of harmony, change, and balance. Subsisto thrives through adaptation, and its Dragonborne reflect this mutable strength.

### The Forbidden God: YAHWEH

Long before the current age, there was a **fourth god**, not a dragon, but the **Human God — YAHWEH**. He was worshipped by the kingdom of **Impotens**, a people who named themselves in recognition of their own powerlessness without their god.

Unlike the others, **YAHWEH did not fall in battle**. When Ignis, under Yam’s banner, **destroyed Impotens and slaughtered its people**, YAHWEH **withdrew from the world**, leaving behind only silence — and a curse.

- The **Dragonborne curse** originated from YAHWEH, who **stole humanity itself** from his broken followers. All Dragonborne are remnants of that loss.
- Should a player attempt to **worship YAHWEH**, they will suffer a **horrific death**, bleeding from their eyes as the god’s curse consumes them.

YAHWEH is **not an available god** at the start of the game. His path remains locked until the player **completes the story as all three Dragonborne** — only then may they seek out what remains of the Human God.

## Features

- **Single-god devotion**: Your chosen god defines your powers, fate, and kingdom.
- **3-of-5 ability selection**: Customize your Dragonborne with divine powers.
- **Locked allegiances**: No switching sides — your god is your identity.
- **Hidden divine path**: Unlock YAHWEH by completing all three Dragonborne campaigns.
- **Narrative-driven consequences**: Attempting to break the system leads to death by divine curse.
